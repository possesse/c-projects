What to do to run the program:
  if you only download the .exe program there is a chance where the windows defender might go off and not open the program, but don't worry because there is nothing wrong with my 
program you will just have to download the compiler ming-w64 which is the compiler to make the program run so you will have to download ming-w64 set it 
up as is shown in the video and then you will be able to run the program and you will have no proplemo. 
Also big thanks to Tech with Tim because without him i wouldn't be this far in my cpp knowledge without him.

The video to make ming-w-64 work so your program can work:
  So https://youtu.be/lPd13fsU-CQ this is the link to the video from Tech with Tim showing you how to set up everything for cpp but if you are just a normal
  i have left a copy of ming-w-64 in the fild do you don't have to download it
person not looking for setting your computer up for writing cpp code then skip to the Windows setup section of the video, But, Note:
When you are watching the windows setup part of the video you have to watch the hole windows setup section of the video
otherwise if you don't do the steps correctly with ming-w-64 then the program will still not work.
So i hope you have done all the steps correct and i hope you love the program

project made by me int main(masters) :)
